<h1 align= "center">✨Magic Planner API & Disney Scraper✨</h1>

The Magic Planner API is a RESTful API deployed to serve data to Magic Planner (app in progress). To seed the database, a scraper was created with Python and Selenium. The scrapers were built to visit the Disney World website and extract information like attraction names, hours, and images, and import them into a hosted PostgreSQL database in an effort to spare myself from the hours it would take to manually scape the data.
